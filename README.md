# Project: Fraud Transaction Detection Using Machine Learning
Objective
Build a classification model that can predict whether a transaction is fraudulent based on various features in the dataset. Optimize model performance and deploy it as a web application
Project Workflow
1️⃣   Data Preprocessing
•	Load the dataset using Pandas.
•	Convert TX_DATETIME to a timestamp for time-based fraud pattern detection.
•	Encode categorical features (CUSTOMER_ID, TERMINAL_ID) using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.
•	Normalize TX_AMOUNT using StandardScaler to improve model training.
•	Create additional features:
o	Terminal fraud count: Track fraud occurrences per terminal.
o	Customer spending trends: Compare transaction amounts over time.
2️⃣   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Visualize fraud vs. non-fraud transactions using histograms & box plots.
•	Identify correlations between fraud patterns using a heatmap.
•	Analyze fraud rates based on terminal and customer behavior.
3️⃣   Model Selection
•	Try classification models like:
o	Random Forest, XGBoost, or LightGBM for tabular data.
o	Neural Networks with TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning approaches.
•	Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
•	Use Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for evaluation.

4️⃣   Hyperparameter Tuning
•	Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.
•	Experiment with undersampling or oversampling techniques to balance fraud vs. non-fraud transactions.
5️⃣   Model Deployment (Flask Web App)
•	Save the trained model using joblib or pickle.
•	Build a Flask API that accepts transaction details and returns fraud predictions.
•	Create a simple frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the model.
6️⃣   Deployment to GitHub
•	Deploy on GithtHub to make the fraud detection tool accessible online.

Next Steps
•	Implement real-time fraud detection using streaming tools like Apache Kafka.
•	Experiment with autoencoders or anomaly detection algorithms for unsupervised fraud detection.
•	Add visual dashboards to show fraud trends over time.
